- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance helped me avoid repeating code. I liked how House, Library, and Cafe could all use the Building class and just add their own features.

What worked was using super() to set up each building. I had a small problem remembering to import ArrayList and Hashtable, but I fixed it.

My advice is to build and test one class at a time. Inheritance makes things simpler once you understand it.
